# AI & ML UX Systems Series  
### Recruiter-friendly prototypes that demonstrate applied AI reasoning, model behavior, and ML-aware product design

This series showcases a focused collection of AI/ML UX prototypes designed to communicate **clear product thinking**, **model behavior understanding**, and **practical intelligence-system intuition** — without requiring heavy infrastructure.

It exists to give recruiters, hiring managers, and technical peers a clean, credible view of how you design AI features, reason about models, and turn complex ML concepts into simple, understandable user experiences.

These prototypes are intentionally lightweight: high-signal, easy to demo, and immediately legible to anyone hiring an **AI Product Manager**, **Platform PM**, **Applied AI PM**, or **Product Architect**.

---

## Purpose of This Series  

Most AI PM roles require candidates to show they understand:

- how models behave  
- how model inputs, constraints, and parameters shape output  
- how retrieval works (RAG)  
- how to design UX that reveals system behavior  
- how to reason about safety, drift, and explainability  

This series translates those expectations into **five clear prototypes** — each small enough to understand in seconds, but deep enough to demonstrate real AI product competence.

These are not research demos.  
They are **product artifacts** that show how to evaluate, debug, and communicate model behavior.

## Why This Matters for AI PM Roles  

Every AI PM interviewer looks for four signals:

1. **Model intuition** — how to predict behavior before running it  
2. **Parameter literacy** — temperature, top-k, embeddings, context windows  
3. **UX judgment** — what users need to *understand* and *control*  
4. **Safety mindset** — governance, constraints, and predictable behavior  

This series demonstrates all four in a clean, coherent way.

Each prototype doubles as a portfolio piece and as a conversation tool during interviews:

- “Walk me through how this model makes decisions.”  
- “How would you diagnose drift?”  
- “Show me how prompt sensitivity works.”  
- “Explain embeddings to a non-technical stakeholder.”  

These tools give you instant, visual answers.

## High-Impact Prototypes (Final, Recruiter-Optimized Set)

### **1. Minimal RAG Query Explorer**  
A tiny, visual demonstration of retrieval-augmented generation: embeddings → vector search → context retrieval → answer.

- Shows practical understanding of RAG (listed in most AI PM job descriptions)  
- Demonstrates embeddings + search + context window reasoning  
- Minimal backend required; clean UI over core concepts

### **2. Chat Model Behavior Sandbox**  
A simple sandbox for seeing how model parameters affect outputs.

- Temperature, top-k, and other controls  
- Safety toggle  
- Response variation preview  
- Recruiters immediately understand its purpose

**Live Demo:** https://rtfenter.github.io/Chat-Model-Behavior-Sandbox/  
**Repo:** https://github.com/rtfenter/Chat-Model-Behavior-Sandbox

---

### **3. Model Explainer Playground (XAI Lite)**  
A small explainability demo showing how input features/tokens influence model output.

- User enters text  
- System visualizes token importance  
- Lightweight XAI that feels advanced but is easy to grasp  
- Perfect interview reference

**Live Demo:** _coming soon_  
**Repo:** _coming soon_

### **4. Prompt–Response Variation Explorer**  
A visual playground for comparing how a single prompt produces multiple outputs under different conditions.

- Variation across temperature  
- Side-by-side comparison  
- Shows prompt engineering intuition  
- Connects directly to model evaluation and UX design

**Demo:** https://rtfenter.github.io/Prompt-Response-Variation-Explorer/  
**Repo:** https://github.com/rtfenter/Prompt-Response-Variation-Explorer

---

### **5. Embeddings Visual Map (Mini Version)**  
A compact embeddings visualizer that generates embeddings for 3–6 texts and clusters them in 2D.

- Looks like Pinecone / Weaviate docs  
- Shows spatial meaning relationships  
- A recruiter can understand it in <10 seconds

**Live Demo:** https://rtfenter.github.io/Embeddings-Visual-Map/ 
**Repo:** https://github.com/rtfenter/Embeddings-Visual-Map/blob/main/README.md

## Why These 5 (and Not More)?

Because this series is designed to be:

- **recruiter-friendly**  
- **intuitive on first glance**  
- **aligned to modern AI PM hiring loops**  
- **distinct from your deeper RIA, Systems of Trust, and Platform Systems work**  
- **non-overlapping with loyalty or infrastructure tools**  
- **easy to explain in interviews**  

These prototypes form a perfectly balanced “AI PM surface area”:

- one RAG tool  
- one agent/model behavior tool  
- one explainability tool  
- one prompt-variation tool  
- one embeddings tool  

Enough to show applied depth, without overwhelming.
